                <h2>Chicken</h2>
                <p>
                	Do you eat chicken because you are familiar with the scientific literature on them and have decided that their suffering doesn't matter, or do you do it because it tastes good?And believe me, a good piece of chicken can make anybody believe in the existence of God.

                <h2>Beef</h2>
                <p>
                	If we gave up eating beef we would have roughly 20 to 30 times more land for food than we have now.  If beef is your idea of real food for real people, you'd better live real close to a real good hospital.The end of an ox is beef, and the end of a lie is grief.

                <h2>Sushi</h2>
                <p>
                    I was in a sushi bar over a year ago, and it was just one of those moments that it dawned on me. It hit me over the head, how could I just discriminate between a cow and a fish? I want to take you away from this, "I say, motioning around the kitchen, spastic."
